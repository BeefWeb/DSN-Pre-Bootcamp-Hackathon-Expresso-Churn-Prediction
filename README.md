# DSN-Pre-Bootcamp-Hackathon-Expresso-Churn-Prediction
Expresso-Customer-Churn-Prediction This repository explains how to predict customer churn. An Hackathon Organized by Data Science Nigeria(DSN-AI) to help Expresso predict customer Churn. This is a solution that could have landed me the 22nd positon , log_loss of 0.247107562 on Zindi where the competition was hosted.

Expresso is an African telecommunications company that provides customers with airtime and mobile data bundles. The objective of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of each Expresso customer “churning,” i.e. becoming inactive and not making any transactions for 90 days

My Approach

* Handled Missing Values
* Preprocessed Categorical variables 
* Did Exploratory Data Analysis
* Used Missingno to handle  missing data visualizations and utilities that allowed me to get a quick visual summary of the completeness (or lack thereof) of the dataset. 
* Feature Generation
* KFold Validation


Improvements that can be made

* Feature Selection
* Handling missing data more efficiently
* Hyper-parameter tuning
* Trying some other algorithm
